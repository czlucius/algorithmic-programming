# code-challenges
A repo to store solutions and templates for code challenges like Google Code Jam.

## TODO
Anyone is welcome to contribute to the following:
- Templates for more languages
- Templates for interactive problems (Google Code Jam)
- Templates which make use of multithreading to reduce execution time
- Templates for other programmes (e.g. Open Kattis)


Hope this repo is of good use.
